# arch-setup

This setup covers in my opinion best utilities for creating simple, yet  user-experience on linux.
I will include my config files and try to update them as I learn new things.

## Dependencies

* window manager: hyprland

* terminal: kitty

* runner: anyrun (anyrun-git on aur)

* screenshot: flameshot (don't use prebuild version as it is not compatible with wayland, use flameshot-git from aur)

* topbar: waybar (??)

* notifications: mako (??)
